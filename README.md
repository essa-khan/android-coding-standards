# Android Coding Standards

Each member is responsible for 5 rules and 4 recommendations.

As much as possible, write example programs that will demonstrate 2 or more rules/recommendations together. For examples, if you select rules/recommendations from “File I/O and Logging” (Rule/Rec 01) and “Permission” (Rule/Rec 05), try writing one or more examples that will combine the two or more rules/recommendations from 01 and 05.

When writing sample code, ensure you use JavaDoc style comments.

After reviewing all the Android rules/recommendations, you can also include Java ones.
NOTE: Focus on Rules which are in L2 and L1 level only!
